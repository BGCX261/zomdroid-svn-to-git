= Zomdroid Version 0.7=

We are looking at Monday June 22 to come up with a first shot on Zomdroid.
Hopefully, this version 0.7 will be a basis for propelling other development forward.
The functionality we are going for includes

Two players Human and Zombie
  * When zombie gets within distance x of human, human becomes zombie
  * Uses UI, GPS, Google Maps
  * More to come later
