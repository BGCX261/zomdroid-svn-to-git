#summary This page describes how to use zomdroid.properties to set the phone number and map api key.

= Introduction =

Because the phone number and Google Maps API key must be unique for each developer, we cannot hard-code these into ZomDroid and commit to SVN.  The Android Emulator in Eclipse always has the same phone number, so the server would only have one user.

To get around this, we can use a properties file outside the project space (not in SVN).

= Details =

Here are the steps to get this working:
  # Make sure the emulator is not running
  # Make sure the Android tools directory is in your path [http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r2/installing.html]
  # Create c:\temp (if it doesn't already exist)
  # Create a file called zomdroid.properties
  # Put two lines in the file:
    # phone=1234567890 (must be unique number, so use your real phone number)
    # mapkey=<Key you get for Google Maps API>
  # In Eclipse, go to Window->Show View->Ant
  # Right-click->Add buildfiles...
  # Choose build.xml in the ZomDroid directory
  # You should see the buildfile with two operations
  # Double-click on make.sdcard.  This will make a 256M SD card image called sd.img in c:\temp
  # Go to Run->Run Configurations...
  # Click on the ZomDroid run configuration under Android Application
  # Click on the Target tab
  # Under "Additional Emulator Command Line Options", write "-sdcard c:\temp\sd.img" (this is also in our book on page 112-113)
  # Start the emulator with the ZomDroid run configuration
  # Go back to the Ant view and double-click on load.properties

Once this is done, you should be able to see the zomdroid.properties file in your emulator.  To do this, open the program list on the emulator, go to Dev Tools->Terminal Emulator, and type "ls /sdcard"

ZomDroid will use these values to seed the phone number and map api key.
